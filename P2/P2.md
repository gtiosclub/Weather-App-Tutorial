## Part 2: Set up screen layout for Weather App

**Interface builder** is Xcode's GUI editor. For most projects, the interface is contained in the `Main.storyboard` file. Open it up and have a look around:

For this Weather app, there are 5 parts in the interface we're building:
1. A label to display the location
2. A label to display a description of the weather
3. A label to display the temperature
4. A label to display an icon
5. A bar button item to refresh the weather forecast

### Adding UI Elements

Embed the view controller in a Navigation Controller (select the view controller, Editor-> Embed in -> Navigation Controller), and add the 5 elements described above as well as the necessary constraints to your storyboard. You should have a result similar to this:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/uiResult.png" align="center"> </p>

### WeatherViewController

In order to provide functionality to the app, there must be a way to connect the labels and bar button item to actual code. The ViewController displayed in front of you is automatically connected to a file called `ViewController.swift`. We want a file with a more meaningful name, so you can go ahead and delete `ViewController.swift` and then create a new Swift file named `WeatherViewController.swift`. Make sure this new file is a subclass of `UIViewController`. Your new class should have the following code:

```swift
import UIKit

class WeatherViewController: UIViewController {

}
```

After your `WeatherViewController.swift` file is done, make sure your view controller is connected to this new file. To do this, go back to the storyboard and select the view controller. On the inspector pane to the right, select the identity inspector menu, and make sure the view controller's class is `WeatherViewController.swift`.

Now, let's start with linking the label in our ViewController to the actual Swift code. In order to do this, you click on the label, control-click on it, and drag the blue line that appears to the swift file:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/linkage.png" align="center"> </p>

Then, once you release the blue line, a little screen will pop up as such:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/addOutlet.png" align="center"> </p>

With this screen, you can specify what type of connection you'll make between the label and the code. The type of connection we will need for the label is an `IBOutlet`, which just allows you to edit the label within the code as needed. Go ahead and name the connection `guessLabel`, and then click on `Connect`. The end result should look like this:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/guessLabel.png" align="center"> </p>

Go ahead and do the same linking process to the text field in the view, and name that connection `guessTextField`.

### Label and Button Linking

### Next Time

Awesome! Now we have added connections for both the label and the text field to Swift code! In the next part, we will be adding some functionality for generating a random number to guess, and we will also be connecting the button to the code.
