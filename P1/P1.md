## Part 1: Creating your Xcode project

This tutorial will teach you how to build a Weather app! We will be using a REST API as well as Cocoapods.

The first thing that you will do is create the project within Xcode. So, open up Xcode, and you should be able to see this screen:

Click on "Create a new Xcode project", then a default screen should appear:

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/createProject.png" align="center"> </p>

Go ahead and click "Next", and on the next screen, make your project's name "Guess The Number":

<p align="center"> <img src="/images/inputProjectName.png" align="center"> </p>

Click "Next", and then save the project anywhere you want to on your computer:

Now you have successfully created your new project on Xcode! In the next part, we will actually be creating the interface for the Guess the Number game.
