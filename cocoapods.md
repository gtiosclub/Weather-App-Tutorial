## Part ?: CocoaPods

**CocoaPods** is a dependency manager for Swift and Objective-C Cocoa projects. It has over 24 thousand libraries and is used in over 1.2 million apps. You can learn more on the [CocoaPods website](https://cocoapods.org/).

If you have not already done so, you should go ahead and install Cocoapods. To do this, open a Terminal and run this command `sudo gem install cocoapods`. To complete the setup enter this command: `pod setup --verbose`. You're now setup to use CocoaPods!
