## Part 6: Finishing Up

Now that you're done, you can push your changes to GitHub!

Github is a platform to easily save your code onto a cloud where you can track the changes you've made over time. It also allows others to see and contribute to your open source code. If you haven't done so yet:

1. Sign up for an account at [Github](https://www.github.com)
2. Set up your github [SSH Keys](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/)

Once you're set up, log into [Github](https://www.github.com) and create a new repository by pressing the "+" button on the top right corner, and then on "New repository," like on the image below:

Type in your repository's name, "Guess the Number", and press "Create repository."

You will now be taken to your repository's page. Open up your terminal and navigate into the `Guess The Number` folder using `cd`. Follow the instructions for "...or create a new repository on the command line" to push your code.
